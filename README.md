# Cyclic-vectors-for-certain-D-modules-IGL-2020
The idea of this project is to find an elementary proof to a technical result used in a recent (2018) paper about vertex algebras. The result states when a certain module over a non-commutative algebra of differential operators is generated by a single specific element. The idea is to use computer assistants to perform algebraic calculations and eventually find a more elementary proof of this result. If successful there are a considerable amount of generalizations of the result that we could explore and try to prove.

### A Beginner's guide to git
Note: To open the terminal in jupyter notebook click new in the upper right side corner of the first page and there should be an option that is terminal.
Also, before messing with git you must install sageMath (https://www.sagemath.org/) and jupyterNotebook (https://jupyter.org/install) for your operating system. 

### 1. Creating the repository
1. Clone the repository by typing "git clone https://github.com/goldenxuett/Cyclic-vectors-for-certain-D-modules-IGL-2020.git" into the command line.
2. Create your own branch by typing "git branch insert_your_net_id_here" where you type your own netid in "insert_your_net_id_here." This is to make sure that no one overwrites each other's work.
3. Navigate to your own branch by typing "git checkout branch_name" where branch name should be your own netid.

### 2. Navigating around the terminal
the command "ls" will show you everything in the current directory (fancy name for folder) and the command "cd insert_directory_name_here" will allow you to change what directory you are currently in. 

### 3. Commiting changes to the repository
1. First type "git add ." which will add all of the current changes from your current directory
2. Then type "git commit -m "Type your commit message here""
3. Finally type git push and enter your github username and password to add the files to your branch on the remote repository. These changes can be acessed on the github page by clicking "branch" and navigating to your own branch. 
(Note: if you look online you may find information about "pull requests". However, since we are not merging together the branches we will not worry about utilizing pull requests.)
