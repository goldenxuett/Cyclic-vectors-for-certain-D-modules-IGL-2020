# Cyclic-vectors-for-certain-D-modules-IGL-2020
The idea of this project is to find an elementary proof to a technical result used in a recent (2018) paper about vertex algebras. The result states when a certain module over a non-commutative algebra of differential operators is generated by a single specific element. The idea is to use to computer assistants to perform algebraic calculations and eventually find a more elementary proof of this result. If successful there are a considerable amount of generalizations of the result that we could explore and try to prove.
